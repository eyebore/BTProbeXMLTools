eztz.py:
Script to modify timeZone config paramater in BT hardware probes. Can be used to change timezone in a list of probes
with a single command (when switching to/from DST).
Copy the file to the VBC server and run from there, python and required libraries should already be avialable.
To run from another computer with python available may require installing requests (pip install requests)

csv2xml.py and xml2csv.py:
Scripts for converting files between BT XML multicast stream list configuration and CSV.
Can be used to help import/export stream configuration data to a spreadsheet for simplified manual editing.

First row of CSV file must contain the stream paramater names as they appear in the exported XML configuration.
The 'params' array in xml2csv.py includes all paramaters for Stream List with joininfo (mask 0x80) in BT SW version 5.5.

Both scripts require single file name paramater to run. 
The same file name with modified three letter extension (.csv <> .xml) is used for the output file.
Existing files are overwritten.

Example:

python csv2xml.py MyCSVFile.csv

will write XML data to a file called MyCSVFile.xml
